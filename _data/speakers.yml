  name: "James"
  surname: "Evans"
  company: "University of Chicago"
  title: "Professor, Department of Sociology, University of Chicago"
  bio: 'James Evans research focuses on the collective system of thinking and knowing, ranging from the distribution of attention and intuition, the origin of ideas and shared habits of reasoning to processes of agreement (and dispute), accumulation of certainty (and doubt), and the texture—novelty, ambiguity, topology—of understanding. He is especially interested in innovation—how new ideas and practices emerge—and the role that social and technical institutions (e.g., the Internet, markets, collaborations) play in collective cognition and discovery. Much of his work has focused on areas of modern science and technology, but he is also interested in other domains of knowledge—news, law, religion, gossip, hunches, machine, and historical modes of thinking and knowing.'

His research has been published in journals including The American Economic Review, The Journal of Political Economy, The Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences, and Science. This research spans three areas. The first is the economics of innovation and creativity. This work studies the production, diffusion, and value of innovations, including how creativity varies over the life cycle, how an individual’s own creativity is affected by the presence of other important innovators, and disparities among researchers. The second area is family and neighborhood determinants of youth outcomes and behavior. This work studies how youth behaviors, including employment, delinquency, cognitive development, and risky behaviors, are affected by their families and peer groups. The third research area concerns technological change, industrial shifts, and the wage structure. This work studies how computerization and the shift from manufacturing to services have affected the gender wage gap, the racial wage gap, and the returns to experience."
